  Course Description
SYDE 162:
Design of human-machine environments, design to reduce human error. Analytical methods of determining user needs in systems with humans. Information processing and human sensory processes and consideration of these elements in the design of systems with humans. Human physical capabilities and consideration of these in ergonomic design. [Offered: S]
Prereq: 1B Systems Design Engineering. Antireq: BME 162
Additional Description:
SYDE 162, Human Factors in Design, is the second course in the SYDE Design course sequence. We will extend learning from SYDE 161 Introduction to Design by focusing on user/workplace requirements as they apply to the design of human-machine systems. In Human Factors in Design, we will introduce students to the discipline of human factors engineering and how it informs design decisions to improve design outcomes from the perspective of overall safety and human performance.
Students will be exposed to human factors engineering concepts and analytical techniques relating to user experience and usability design, physical workplace design, and complex system design through lectures, assignments, case studies, and tests.
See the course schedule for a breakdown of topics covered each week, assignment and test deadlines, and more.

Student Assessment
Component Value
Three Tests (Individual, 20% each) 60%
Assignments (Best 5/6, 6% each)) 30%
Participation Activities 3%
Ethics 7%
Additional Student Assessment Information
Importantly, you must pass the tests (≥ 50%) to access the grades for the group assignments. If you fail Test 1, the weighting for Assignment 1 and 2 will be shifted to Test 1. If you fail Test 2, the weighting for Assignment 3 and 4 will be shifted to Test 2. If you fail Test 3, the weighting for Assignment 5 and 6 will be shifted to Test 3. This would increase the weighting associated with the test from 20% to 32%. Given that the lowest scoring assignment is dropped, the first time this occurs, one assignment would be dropped and the weighting for only one assignment would shift to the test, making that test worth 26% instead of 32%. 
Course Evaluation:
All evaluated course work (assignments, quizzes, tests, etc.) must be solely the work of the student or students submitting it for credit.
Participation activities, quizzes and tests are to be completed independently with no collaboration with other students. The instructor reserves the right to have follow-up conservations with individual students to ensure that the work submitted was completed on their own. Marks may be adjusted, or disciplinary action taken, based on these conversations and other sources of evidence.
Late submissions will not be graded and will receive a grade of zero. Up to three grace days can be used for the group assignments. Up to three grace days can be used for the following individual activities: participation activities and the TCPS2 Certificate. Students must email the instructor before the assignment deadline to use these grace days.
It is expected that all group members will contribute to the group assignments. Any group issues related to non-participating group members should be brought to the attention of Professor Robert Hunter or a teaching assistant as soon as possible. Individual members’ group assignment grades may be adjusted at the instructor’s discretion based on level of participation. In extreme circumstances, a non-participating group member may be removed from the group and tasked with completing group assignments individually.
Deliverable Formatting
Unless otherwise stated in provided deliverable instructions, the following formatting expectations apply to submissions:
Maximum page size is 8.5 by 11 inches.
Margins must be no smaller than 0.5 inches.
11 or 12 pt. font size.
Times New Roman, Arial, or other similar professional and legible font styles.
References, when expected, must follow IEEE guidelines.
File submissions should be .pdf files.
Grade penalties for not following formatting expectations may be applied at the discretion of the course instructor. 
Assignment Screening
No assignment screening will be used in this course.

Administrative Policy
Generative AI
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, may be used for assignments in this class with proper documentation, citation, and acknowledgement. Recommendations for how to cite GenAI in student work at the University of Waterloo may be found through the Library: https://subjectguides.uwaterloo.ca/chatgpt_generative_ai. Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. 
In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence 
You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI. 
Course and Departmental Expectations
Guiding Principles for our SYDE-BME Community (faculty, staff, and students):
1. Be compassionate. 2. Be accountable. 3. Be patient.4. Be safe and healthy.
Compassionate and respectful communication: Most online communication between the Department and students will be done through LEARN and/or email. Students are reminded that they should now use their email accountname@uwaterloo.ca. Include an academic signature with your full name, program, student ID. We encourage you to include your preferred pronouns (he/him; she/her; they/them).
Scheduling of Synchronous (live) online course events: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all University of Waterloo courses components will be delivered online, until further notice. To maintain build supportive teaching environments, instructors may use the time slots (EDT) scheduled “in-class” hours to hold “live-stream” events such as lectures, tutorial help sessions, group activities, and open office hours. To accommodate different time zones, different working/studying conditions and limitations in internet access, all critical course components, including lectures and student support must be made available in asynchronous formats. Any timed component (e.g. test/quiz) must take time zone and internet availability into account.
SYDE-BME COMMENT ON ACCOMMODATION: We respect that our SYDE-BME
students are independent adult decision-makers, with many opportunities to partake in activities that might be in time conflict with academic deadlines and deliverables. Along with the right to make adult decisions comes the responsibility and accountability for those decisions and any outcomes.
The University of Waterloo’s policy on accommodation for missed deliverables pertains to verifiable health matters, and highly unfortunate events (e.g. family tragedies). The Department of Systems Design Engineering follows UW’s general policy: students who self-elect to forgo a deliverable receive a “0” for that deliverable. It is preferred practice so that fairness is maintained for members of the same class/course by avoiding preferential treatment, and so that instructors are not burdened with having to create extra quizzes, deliverables, etc. It also reflects professional practice, as failing to show up to work and missing deadlines can be very costly to the company and individual (e.g. not submitting a contract proposal, or design review on time). Please read the policy here: Accommodation due to illness.
SYDE-BME Academic Priorities over Co-op Interviews: With asynchronous schedules, students should be able to arrange co-op interviews that do not conflict with major deliverables (i.e. timed course midterms, final exams). For deliverables with longer time windows (e.g. 24-48 hours or more),students must manage their time for deliverables and co-op interviews accordingly. If a co-op interview conflicts with a short deliverable time window (e.g. 1-3 hours), then students MUST follow the CECA procedure for rescheduling the interview: CECA rescheduling co-op interviews.
Compassionate Accommodation: If you are facing challenges that are affecting more than one course contact the Associate Chair Undergraduate (ACUG sydeunde@uwaterloo.ca) or the Directorof BME (sdbmedir@uwaterloo.ca ). They will review your case and coordinate a reasonable and fair plan in consultation with appropriate others (e.g. instructors, Department Undergraduate Studies Committee, Chair, AccessAbility Services, Engineering Counselling services, Registrar's Office).
 Faculty of Engineering Guiding Practices. 
Territorial Acknowledgement: The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within the Office of Indigenous Relations. 
Inclusive Teaching-Learning Spaces: The University of Waterloo values the diverse and intersectional identities of its students, faculty, and staff. The University regards equity and diversity as an integral part of academic excellence and is committed to accessibility for all. We consider our classrooms, online learning, and community spaces to be places where we all will be treated with respect, dignity, and consideration. We welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability – and other visible and nonvisible differences. We are all expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive teaching- learning environment. Any member of the campus community who has experienced discrimination at the University is encouraged to seek guidance from the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion & Anti-racism (EDI-R) via email at equity@uwaterloo.ca. Sexual Violence Prevention & Response Office (SVPRO), supports students at UWaterloo who have experienced, or have been impacted by, sexual violence and gender-based violence. This includes those who experienced harm, those who are supporting others who experienced harm. SVPRO can be contacted at svpro@uwaterloo.ca
Religious & Spiritual Observances: The University of Waterloo has a duty to accommodate religious and spiritual observances under the Ontario Human Rights Code. Please inform the instructor at the beginning of term if special accommodation needs to be made for religious observances that are not otherwise accounted for in the scheduling of classes and assignments. Consult with your instructor(s) within two weeks of the announcement of the due date for which accommodation is being sought. 
Respectful Communication and Pronouns: Communications with Instructor(s) and teaching assistants (TAs) should be through recommended channels for the course (e.g., email, LEARN, Piazza, Teams, etc.) Please use your UWaterloo email address. Include an academic signature with your full name, program, student ID. We encourage you to include your pronouns to facilitate respectful communication (e.g., he/him; she/her; they/them). You can update your chosen/preferred name at WatIAM. You can update your pronouns in Quest. 
Mental Health and Wellbeing Resources: If you are facing challenges impacting one or more courses, contact your academic advisor, Associate Chair Undergraduate, or the Director of your academic program. Mental health is a serious issue for everyone and can affect your ability to do your best work. We encourage you to seek out mental health and wellbeing support when needed. The Faculty of Engineering Wellness Program has programming and resources for undergraduate students. For counselling (individual or group) reach out to Campus Wellness and Counselling Services. Counselling Services is an inclusive, non-judgmental, and confidential space for anyone to seek support. They offer confidential counselling for a variety of areas including anxiety, stress management, depression, grief, substance use, sexuality, relationship issues, and much more. 
Intellectual Property: Be aware that this course contains the intellectual property of their instructor, TA, and/or the University of Waterloo. Intellectual property includes items such as:
Lecture content, spoken and written (and any audio/video recording thereof).
Lecture handouts, presentations, and other materials prepared for the course (e.g., PowerPoint slides).
Questions or solution sets from various types of assessments (e.g., assignments, quizzes, tests, final exams); and
Work protected by copyright (e.g., any work authored by the instructor or TA or used by the instructor or TA with permission of the copyright owner).
Course materials and the intellectual property contained therein are used to enhance a student’s educational experience. However, sharing this intellectual property without the intellectual property owner’s permission is a violation of intellectual property rights. For this reason, it is necessary to ask the
instructor, TA and/or the University of Waterloo for permission before uploading and sharing the intellectual property of others online (e.g., to an online repository).
Permission from an instructor, TA or the University is also necessary before sharing the intellectual property of others from completed courses with students taking the same/similar courses in subsequent terms/years. In many cases, instructors might be happy to allow distribution of certain materials. However, doing so without expressed permission is considered a violation of intellectual property rights and academic integrity.
Please alert the instructor if you become aware of intellectual property belonging to others (past or present) circulating, either through the student body or online.
Continuity Plan - Fair Contingencies for Unforeseen Circumstances (e.g., resurgence of COVID-19): In the event of emergencies or highly unusual circumstances, the instructor will collaborate with the Department/Faculty to find reasonable and fair solutions that respect rights and workloads of students, staff, and faculty. This may include modifying content delivery, course topics and/or assessments and/or weight and/or deadlines with due and fair notice to students. Substantial changes after the first week of classes require the approval of the Associate Dean, Undergraduate Studies.
Declaring absences: [undergraduate students and/or courses only]  Regardless of the process used to declare an absence, students are responsible for reaching out to their instructors as soon as possible. The course instructor will determine how missed course components are accommodated. Self-declared absences (for COVID-19 and short-term absences up to 2 days) must be submitted through Quest. Absences requiring documentation (e.g., Verification of Illness Form, bereavement, etc.) are to be uploaded by completing the form on the VIF System. The UWaterloo Verification of Illness form, completed by a health professional, is the only acceptable documentation for an absence due to illness. Do not send documentation to your advisor, course instructor, teaching assistant, or lab coordinator. Submission through the VIF System, once approved, will notify your instructors of your absence. 
Rescheduling Co-op Interviews: Follow the co-op process for rescheduling co-op interviews for conflicts to graded assignments (e.g., midterms, tests, and final exams). Attendance at co-operative work-term employment interviews is not considered to be a valid reason to miss a test.
University Policy
Academic integrity: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check the Office of Academic Integrity for more information.]
Grievance: A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.
Discipline: A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check the Office of Academic Integrity for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to Policy 71, Student Discipline. For typical penalties, check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties.
