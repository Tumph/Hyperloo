Participation Activities:

Weekly attendance activities starting from week 2. Every week the instructor will have a 5 min participation activity in the form of a game/quiz (Kahoot style) in class. This will be unannounced and could be during any lecture day and any time during the lecture (beginning, middle or end). It is every student’s responsibility to attend the class. Those will be marked for completion/participation not correctness. The split of the grade is to reward attending the activities. Missing those will be penalized as follows:

Valid reasons (medical note, short-absence, interviews, any other occasions will not be accepted) approved by the instructor can result in waiving any missed session.



Any student registered with AccessAbility Services who has concerns about accommodations for these deliverables to talk to their Accommodation Consultant and the course instructor by week 2 of the term.



Sharing the code of the session with other classmates that are not present is an academic integrity breach and will be subject to the consequences that could extend to failing the course. In the case of a breach that is unknown the whole class will loose 1 point on their final mark for every breach up to a maximum of 10 points.



Assessments:

4 take-home assignments that need to be done individually (may change based on the instructor’s discretion). The assignments is for us to assess your knowledge and provide you with constructive feedback. Plagiarism detection tools will be used. Individual interview may be conducted, where a student is asked to explain the completed work to the instructor and TA.



Midterm and Final Exams:

Each student must complete the exam solely by her or his own efforts. Learning materials and notes prepared before an exam may be allowed and will be communicated via LEARN by the instructor.

Any missed mid-term exam will receive a mark of 0, unless there is a valid documented reason approved by the instructor. Using short-absence on a midterm exam will shift its weight to other course component – no makeup will be offered. If such a reason is provided and accepted by the instructor, the mid-term weight may be applied to the final exam. If a student is unable to write the final exam, they need to notify the instructor at least 24 hours before the exam (as earlier as possible).





Course Laboratories (SYDE 292L):

The labs will cover practicum related to course topics that deserve more attention beyond the level of coverage given in lectures. Each lab will include practical problems related to the topics covered in lectures. Lab attendance is mandatory.



The lab component is run independently from the course and the lab instructor is in charge of it not the course instructor.

Assignment Screening
No assignment screening will be used in this course.
