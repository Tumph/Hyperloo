  Tentative Course Schedule
</h2>


        
          <div class="html-block">
  
  <p>Each full course at the University of Waterloo consists of 36 lectures spread over nominally twelve weeks of classes. These twelve weeks do not include the autumnal and winter reading weeks. If there are holidays throughout the term, there will be make-up lectures at the end of the term. For example, if the holiday was on a Friday and the make-up lecture is on a Monday, then that Monday will follow a Friday schedule. Also, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering cancels classes during mid-term week and, instead, offers make-up lectures. Thus, the make-up lectures before the mid-term week will speed the progression through the course material, and after mid-term week, we will be initially a lecture or two behind, but then as subsequent make-up lectures occur, we will catch up once again with the schedule below. The schedule below is "tentative" and not intended to reflect exactly what topics are covered in which week of the course.</p><p><strong>Week 1</strong><br>Literal data; identifies; local variables and initialization and assignment thereof; arithmetic, comparison and logical operators; and conditional (if) statements.</p><p><strong>Week 2</strong><br>Assignment operators; for-loops and while loops; scope of local variables; break statements; the structured programming theorem; and the call stack.</p><p><strong>Week 3</strong><br>Libraries and function calls; writing functions; assertions; code-development strategies; writing tests and comments; and logging.</p><p><strong>Week 4</strong><br>Debugging; binary and hexadecimal numbers; integer data types; bitwise and bit-shift operators; floating-point data types; constant variables; and the default value of parameters.</p><p><strong>Week 5</strong><br>Reference variables, pass by reference and aliases; arrays; main memory; the call stack; and C-style strings.</p><p><strong>Week 6</strong><br>Addresses and pointers; dynamic memory allocation including that of arrays; lifetime of dynamically allocated memory; problems with pointers; and protecting pointers with const.</p><p><strong>Week 7</strong><br>Searching of arrays; sorted arrays; binary search; selection and insertion sort; and introduction to recursive algorithms and recursive mathematical functions.</p><p><strong>Week 8</strong><br>Solving problems recursively; the class data structure; namespaces; and functions on objects.</p><p><strong>Week 9</strong><br>Operator overloading; issues with member variables; using member functions; throwing and catching exceptions; classes; encapsulation; and constructors.</p><p><strong>Week 10</strong><br>Copies of objects; assignment of objects; the destructor; dynamic memory allocation in classes; weaknesses with arrays; linked lists; and a linked list with dynamic memory allocation.</p><p><strong>Week 11</strong><br>Adding a size list member variable and a tail pointer member variable; concatenating two linked lists; inheritance; a base linked list class; a window class for graphical user interfaces; exception classes and polymorphism; and a widget class for graphical user interfaces.</p><p><strong>Week 12</strong><br>Room for delayed material and review.</p><p><strong>Project deadlines</strong><br>Each of the five projects are due on a Tuesday at 10:00 pm (22:00):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Project 1 &nbsp; &nbsp;September 24<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Project 2 &nbsp; &nbsp;October 8<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Project 3 &nbsp; &nbsp;November 5<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Project 4 &nbsp; &nbsp;November 19<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Project 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;December 3 (last day of classes)</p>

  Administrative Policy

          <div class="html-block">
  
  <p><strong>Supremacy of the final examination grade: </strong>Any project or mid-term examination grade will be replaced by the grade on the final examination if the grade on the final examination is higher than the grade for a specific project or the mid-term examination. For example, if nothing is submitted throughout the term, your grade on the final-examination will be your final grade. This policy, however, will not be applied if a grade on a project or the mid-term examination is the result of a Policy 71 investigation.</p><p><strong>Extensions: </strong>There will be no extensions granted in this course. If any component of this course is missed, the missing grade will be automatically replaced by the final examination grade as described in the previous point.</p><p><strong>Generative artificial intelligence: </strong>This course includes the independent development and practice of specific skills, such as&nbsp;software design and development. Therefore, the use of&nbsp;Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) trained using large language models (LLM) or other methods to produce text, images, music, or code, like Chat GPT, DALL-E, or GitHub CoPilot, is not permitted in this class. Unauthorized use in this course, such as running course materials through GenAI or using GenAI to complete a course assessment is considered a violation of&nbsp;<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71"><u>Policy 71</u></a>&nbsp;(plagiarism or unauthorized aids or assistance).&nbsp;Work produced with the assistance of GenAI tools does not represent the author’s original work and is therefore in violation of the fundamental values&nbsp;of academic integrity including honesty, trust, respect, fairness, responsibility and courage (<a href="https://academicintegrity.org/images/pdfs/20019_ICAI-Fundamental-Values_R12.pdf"><u>ICAI</u></a>, n.d.).</p><p>You should be prepared to show your&nbsp;work. To demonstrate your learning, you should keep your rough notes, including research notes, brainstorming, and drafting notes. You may be asked to submit these notes along with earlier drafts of their work, either through saved drafts or saved versions of a document.&nbsp;If the use of GenAI is suspected where not permitted, you may be asked to meet with your instructor or teaching assistant (TA) to provide explanations to support the submitted material as being your original work. Through this process, if you have not sufficiently supported your work, academic misconduct allegations may be brought to the Associate Dean.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear.

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>

<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>

[Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>.

<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground.
